# Statistics with Python

A collection of examples of solving statistical problems with Python.

## Why Python

R is a language dedicated to statistics.
Python is a general-purpose language with statistics modules.
R has more statistical analysis features than Python.
For example, R has better time-series analysis and modeling modules.
The statistics capability in Python is still evolving
and hopefully will become better as the demand grows.
When it comes to building big-data analysis pipelines that
mix statistics with other functionalities,
Python is a better choice.

## Requirements

- Python environment including python3, numpy, scipy.
- Pandas (dataframe manipulation)
- Statsmodels (Python stats modules)
